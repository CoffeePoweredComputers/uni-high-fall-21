## Course Description
This course is intended to be a gentle introduction to the world of 
computer science. You will be covering:
1. A general overview of how computer evolved to be what they are today.
2. The fundamentals of programming in the Python language.
3. How the internet works and how to make a basic website.
4. Version control with Git/GitHub.

## Course Elements

### zyBooks and Post-Reading

In a typical week there will be two zyBooks readings and post readings assigned. The zyBook activities are interleaved with the text and are intended to offer you the opportunity to actively practice the concepts you are reading about. After completing each zyBook activity you will complete an associated post reading activity on PrairieLearn that is intended to garner (1) your thoughts about the chapter, (2) your points of confusion, and (3) how long the activity took you. The third point is especially important early on the first semester as it will allow me to gauge and then scale the future assignment in order to ensure the course has a manageable workload.

The cost of the textbook is $33.50.

### Lecture

Given the reading materials, participation activities, and post-readings are due before lecture. The lectures will be focused on the following:

* Addressing the salient points of each section.
* Addressing points of confusion as reported in the muddiest points.

These two points will be done via in class poll questions. These polls will use ABCD cards which can be downloaded at the following links:

* [Apple Version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/abcd-cards/id1212769036)
* [Android Version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greeneb4.ABCDCards&hl=en&gl=US)

If you do not wish or are unable to download the app there are paper versions I will happily provide. Any remaining time after the lecture is intended to be used for either homework or reading activities in an effort to further cut down on your homework. You are welcome to work with your peers and seek my assistance. In the event there is a question or set of questions that is causing several people in the class some amount of difficulty I may elect have the class solve it together with my assistance. 

Additionally, some lectures have been allotted to cover special topics of interest or review days. The former will be treated as a sort of workshop day, half-way between a lecture and a lab. Review days will be used to review topics of interest based on muddiest points.


### Homework

Homework assignment will be due after all other assignments relating to the topic's sections that it covers. These will be completed on PrairieLearn and cover a variety of problem types including:
* True/False
* Multiple Choice
* Parsons Problems 
* Code fixing
* Programming
You are encouraged to work on these problems with your peers either in person on on the class Discord. My schedule outside of office hours can be somewhat turbulent but you are always encouraged to ping me for help if a problem doesn't make sense of takes too long. If a problem is taking too long please do not spend undue time on it, rather, complete which problems you can and come to office hours to go over the rest.

 
## Challenge Activities

The challenge activities are assigned at the beginning of the week and are due the following Sunday. These are some of the more difficult problems in the course so I encourage you to get an early start and complete those which you can during the weeks participation readings. Those which you do not complete during the week can be completed on the weekends. I am available on Discord during the weekend so feel free to ping me with any of your confusions

### Labs

The labs in this course will take place on Anchor days and offer you a chance to exercise the material in a more traditional setting. Early on in the semester we will cover the basics of the Git version control system as well as some more straightforward lab both using a local editor and Python interpreter as well as Google Collaboratory.

For the labs please download one of the following editors, or any other editor of your choice, to your machine:
* [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [vim](https://www.vim.org/)
* [sublime 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

Additionally, please ensure the latest version of Python is installed to your machine: [Python 3.9.x](https://www.python.org/).

## Quizzes and the Final Exam

Each quarter will have two quizzes that cover, on average, four topics. The final exam will take place during finals week. Both the quizzes and the final exam will have randomized practice exams containing a mix of previous homework questions as well as some new ones. The live quizzes will be of identical structure to their associated practice versions but will contain new problems.

During quizzes and the final exam you are allowed access to [repl.it](https://replit.com/~), an online Python interpreter you can use to test your code before submitting it for points.
