# Getting Help

Please refer to to the material below for how to get help and ask questions **early and often**.

The following resources are available to help you with all of your questions:
* **Peers:** For all homework and post-reading assignments you are *encouraged* to seek help from your peers.
* **Office Hours** - Office hours with the instructor will be hosted on Discord. Please refer to the course schedule [weekly schedule](https://hamiltonfour.tech/uni-high-fall-21/schedule/).
* **Calendly** - If you have any questions related to the course or need one-on-one help that cannot be addressed in office hour session you may elect to sign up for a 15 minute meeting with the instructor on Calendly. *This is not office hours and is only intended for help that cannot be addressed in office hours or on CampusWire*.
