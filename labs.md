# Labs 

Every Monday of the class will be a lab day where we will apply concepts that we learned the previous week to either small activities or large projects. Projects will need to be completed individually however you are both welcome and encouraged to work with your peers on the conceptual portions of the lab. However, any code that you turn in must be your own. To avoid copying one and others code I suggest discussing things at an abstract level or sketching out solutions.

##### Labs
1. Setup and Intro to Git/GitHub
2. Git/GitHub Activities

# Suggested Software

* __Python3.9:__ https://www.python.org/downloads/
* __Visual Studio Code:__ https://code.visualstudio.com/

We will go over the installation of this software on your personal machines during the first lab though you are welcome to attempt the installation and setup process on your own.
